# Sortlify

## Features

- **File Explorer View**: Browse files with list and grid/thumbnail views.
- **Dynamic Sorting & Filtering**: Sort files by name, size, type, or date, and apply filters.
- **Customizable Themes**: Switch between light and dark modes with accent color choices.
- **Custom Rules Engine**: Define "if-then" rules for advanced sorting (e.g., if filename contains "invoice," move to Finance).
